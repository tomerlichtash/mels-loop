# Mel's Loop

## A Comprehensive Companion to _The Story of Mel_

Mel's Loop is a comprehenseive companion and guide for _The Story of Mel_, an epic Hacker Folklore tale that was written and published by its author, Ed nather, on Usenet in 1983. The story describes an exemplary "Real Programmer" by the name of Mel Kaye and his subtle techniques fascinate his colleagues. The story is one of the earliest documenations of The Hacker Spirit, and the themes in the story are still valid to this day.

In Mel's Loop we will also collect a lot of sub-stories around _The Story of Mel_, its author, Ed Nather, and Mel Kaye himself. This is an historical (or rather an e-archeological) ongoing research into the world of Ed, Mel, their families and life stories, first generation computing and the birth of digital culture, hacker lore and more.

Alongside _The Story of Mel_, Mel's Loop project is designed as an anthology for other stories, poems and relics in the Hacker Folklore genre. We acknowlege the aesthetic and literary value of such stories, and we aim at providing them with quality translations.
