1. Real Programmers Don't Use PASCAL. Ed Post, Tektronix, 1982. The article's author argues that it'd be better to write any sort of code in a low level languageg (" If you can't do it in FORTRAN, do it in assembly language. If you can't do it in assembly language, it isn't worth doing."). The title of the article references a machoistic parody that was published that year by the name "Real Men Don't Eat Quiche. Bruce Feirstein, Pocket Books, 1983". A common belief is that The Story of Mel was published in response to the publication of this article in Datamation, however - it is now clear that the Story of Mel was published nearly two monthes prior to the publication of "Real Programmers Don't Use PASCAL" in Datamation, and that The Story of Mel, that was published over Usenet, was probably triggered by an early e-publication of the mentioned article, probably over Usenet.
