Assembly Language - In computer programming, assembly language (or assembler language) is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions. Because assembly depends on the machine code instructions, every assembly language is designed for exactly one specific computer architecture. Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code. (Source: Wikiepdia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language)
