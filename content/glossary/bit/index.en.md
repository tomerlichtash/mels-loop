The most basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. The name is a contraction of "binary digit". The bit represents a logical state with one of two possible values. These values are most commonly represented as either "1" or "0", but other representations such as true/false, yes/no, +/âˆ’, or on/off are commonly used.
