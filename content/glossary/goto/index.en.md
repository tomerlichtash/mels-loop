GO TO - is a statement found in many computer programming languages. It performs a one-way transfer of control to another line of code. The jumped-to locations are usually identified using labels, though some languages use line numbers. At the machine code level, a goto is a form of branch or jump statement. Many languages support the goto statement, and many do not. (Source: Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto)
