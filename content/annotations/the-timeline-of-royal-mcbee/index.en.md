The Typewriter Company 'Royal' was founded in 1904 and for 5 decades it developed technologies and patents in the field of typewriter machines. After WWII the company had entered, rather belatedly, to the field of portable typewriter machines, but the market had already looked beyond that, to the field of automated mechanichal typewriter machines, and so did Royal. In July 1954 Royal partnered up with McBee, a manufacturer of calculation tools for accounting and statistics. About 2 years later, the parterns have signed up with General Percision, and Royal-McBee operated as the manufactuerer and marketer for the LGP-30 compute (??? -- in 1963 it provided similar services to the LGP-21 -- ???). Until 1964 the company's profits(?) succeeded from $84.7M to over $113M, and for years it had appeared in the Fortune 500 list.
