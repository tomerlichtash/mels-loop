1. Real Programmers Don't Use PASCAL. Ed Post, Tektronix, 1982. Its main argument is that modern programming constructs are superfluous and used only by weak developers (“quiche eaters”). "If you can't code in Fortran, code it in assembly. If you can't code in assembly, it's not worth coding at all", asserts the article, referring to the “pure” version of Fortran, before it was polluted by fashionable ideas like structured programming. Some discussions attribute the article’s debut to the Datamation journal, but the timeline suggests otherwise. _The Story of Mel_, written as a humoristic rebuttal to this article, appeared in May 1983, 2 months before the relevant Datamation issue. Therefore, it’s very likely that Ed Post’s piece first appeared on USENET. The title is a parody on a book called Real Men Don’t Eat Quiche (Bruce Feirstein, Pocket Books), which also inspired the macho tone of the text.


2. Slang, a subculture in Hacker culture. For the "Real Programmer" the challenge lies in the complexity of a problem, the elegance of the solution and its efficiency. The product and its users are secondary, if considered at all.

3. Fortran - The first  (1954) commercial high-level language and the first to boast a commercial-grade compiler. Still used in the fields of numeric and scientific computation.

4. Electronic hand calculators first appeared in 1971, with the influential HP-35 pocket calculator arriving soon afterwards in 1972. This signalled the end of the slide-rule era in engineering. (Source: https://www.cs.utah.edu/~elb/folklore/mel-annotated/node2.html#SECTION00020000000000000000)

5. The term 'user-friendly' is used in quotations here in, I believe, a couple of different meanings. One is that software that is called 'user-friendly' very often isn't. Oftentimes the extra window dressing put onto a piece of software to make it user-friendly serves mostly to make it harder to use. The other meaning is a reference to the 'real programmer' ethic. One on-line collection of real-programmer-isms says something to the effect of `Software is hard to write, it should be hard to use.'' To programmers of this ethic, adding extra code simply to make the program easier to use is wasted effort. People who value the contribution of the code should have to spend the effort to learn how to use it.

6. _The Story of Mel_ takes place circa 1959-1960 in Librascope offices in Glendale, California, USA.

7. About 100 kinds of first generation computers, built around 1942-1963.

8. Drum Memory - refers to drum memories which are magnetic data storage devices much like the familiar hard disks of today but shaped like cylinders instead of platters. In the 50's and 60's the state of the art in magnetic encoding of data didn't allow for very dense storage on the magnetic surface of the medium. So, in order to increase the surface area of the storage medium, to increase the speed at which the magnetic material passed by the read head of the device, and to keep the speed at which the heads encountered the magnetic medium constant, these devices were shaped like cylinders with the magnetic coating on the outside surface of the cylinder and the cylinder rotating along its long axis at very high speeds. Consider the early phonographs which were wax cylinders versus the now-becoming-obsolete vinyl record. The considerations are analogous to the drum versus disk question. (Source: https://www.cs.utah.edu/~elb/folklore/mel-annotated/node2.html#SECTION00020000000000000000)

9. Vacuum tubes are electronic devices used to amplify electronic signals and to act as electronically controlled switches. Digital computers are constructed at their most basic fundamental building blocks as electronically controlled switches. The very first electronic computers used relays for these switches (in the 1940's). Vacuum tubes were used for the switches from the late 40's to the late 50's. The first commercial computer to use transistors for the switching elements was the IBM 1401 in 1959 starting the end of the tube era. Individual transistors gave way to integrated circuits in which hundreds, and eventually millions, of transistors were fabricated on a single silicon substrate, or chip. Integrated circuits have been used from the mid-60's to the present. (Source: https://www.cs.utah.edu/~elb/folklore/mel-annotated/node2.html#SECTION00020000000000000000)

10. In computer programming, machine code, consisting of machine language instructions, is a low-level programming language used to directly control a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction causes the CPU to perform a very specific task, such as a load, a store, a jump, or an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) operation on one or more units of data in the CPU's registers or memory.
For instance, an instruction that is used to perform addition to the content in Register A with the content in Register B and save the result to Register C would look like thus: 1010 0011 0100 0001. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code)

11. Rational FORTRAN (RATFOR) is a dialect of FORTRAN that provides a richer set of control-flow possibilities. RATFOR is not a new language, rather it is a translator that translates Rational FORTRAN into FORTRAN. It allows the programmer to use features not found in the normal FORTAN language, and then translates those features into standard FORTAN automatically. (Source: https://www.cs.utah.edu/~elb/folklore/mel-annotated/node2.html#SECTION00020000000000000000)

12. Assembly Language - In computer programming, assembly language (or assembler language) is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions. Because assembly depends on the machine code instructions, every assembly language is designed for exactly one specific computer architecture. Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code. (Source: Wikiepdia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language)

13. In mathematics and computing, the hexadecimal (also base 16 or hex) numeral system is a positional numeral system that represents numbers using a radix (base) of 16. Unlike the common way of representing numbers using 10 symbols, hexadecimal uses 16 distinct symbols, most often the symbols "0"–"9" to represent values 0 to 9, and "A"–"F" (or alternatively "a"–"f") to represent values 10 to 15. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)

14. Mel Kaye (Melvin Kornitzky, 1931-2018) was born in Brooklyn to a family of Jewish immigrants and during his childhood moved with his family to Los Angeles. In Summer 1956 Mel joined the commercial department of Librascope, a technology division within General Percision, which held goverment and army contracts. Mel was employed as an Application Engineer in the Commercial Development department in the company's new and fancy Building 3 in Glendale, California, and also acted as a support person to the company's clients to the LGP-30. Within a month from his hiring date, Mel was transferred, along with few other engineers, to Royal-McBee, a business partner of General Percision, that had taken the task of marketing and selling the LGP-30. During his time in Royal-McBee Mel wrote a Blackjack game that ran on the LGP-30, and soon became the flagship demo program for the new machine and was widely used by the company.
When the RPC-4000 was launched Mel had re-wrote (or 'ported') the Blackjack program to be compatible with the RPC-4000, for which he also wrote parts of the Assembly, and as we know from _The Story of Mel_ - also helped Ed Nather with the task of writing a Fortran Compiler to that machine. Due to some differences with the company's managment Mel left Royal-McBee in the early 1960s. Some relics remained of his work, including few hand-written code sheets and a usage guide to the Blackjack program for the RPC-4000.

15. The Typewriter Company 'Royal' was founded in 1904 and for 5 decades it developed technologies and patents in the field of typewriter machines. After WWII the company had entered, rather belatedly, to the field of portable typewriter machines, but the market had already looked beyond that, to the field of automated mechanichal typewriter machines, and so did Royal. In July 1954 Royal partnered up with McBee, a manufacturer of calculation tools for accounting and statistics. About 2 years later, the parterns have signed up with General Percision, and Royal-McBee operated as the manufactuerer and marketer for the LGP-30 compute (??? -- in 1963 it provided similar services to the LGP-21 -- ???). Until 1964 the company's profits(?) succeeded from $84.7M to over $113M, and for years it had appeared in the Fortune 500 list.

16. In December 1964 Royal-McBee was purchased by Litton, and in 1965 Litton removed the the named McBee. In March 1967 Volkswagen annouced its intention to purchase 55% of Litton's shares through Triumph-Adler, a company owned by Litton, within these shares - the holding of Typewriter Royal. Until 1982 the earnings from sales of Royal and Triumph-Adler piled up to about $600M. In 1983, about a year after this storm of business merges, when Ed Nather publishes _The Story of Mel_, he looks at what used to be Royal-McBee - and sees a ghost. The on-going incarnation of this ghost continued in 1986, when the italian company Olivettei purchased the holdings in Royal. 20 years later, in September 2004, Royal returned to be an American company. Today it's opearing under the name Royal Consumer Information Products Inc. The company manufactures, markets and sells cash registers, paper shredders, electronic logging devices and accessories for photocopiers.

17. A first generation digital computer that was released to the market on November 1955 in a retail price of $47,000. The LGP-30 was branded as a cheap and mobile computer, easy to program with large memory and reliable performence, aimed at applications for research, engineering, industry and military. About 500 computer was manufactured and sold around the globe. The computer’s name is an acronym of its manufacturers - Librascope General Percision. Despite its proportions, the LGP-30 was considered to be a small computer, and is often referenced as the first Desktop Computer, as its size was that of an average desk (Height: 34cm, Width: 120cm, Depth: 66cm). With heavy duty wheels installed on its bottom to, allow moving it around the room, it was also considered to be a mobile computer. Under the brownish-bronze hood, with the power of 1500 watts, the LGP-30 had 113 vacuum tubes, 1450 diodes, 34 slot cards, a memory drum with the capacity of 4096 words (word = 32 bit) and 3 index registers. The Input/Ouput device of the computer was the Flexowriter - an electro-mechanical typewriter with a paper-tape reader and puncher, and alphanumeric output capabilities. The computer also included a self-cooling mechanism installed on its chassis, and an oscilloscope installed on its front to monitor its activity, next to an interface of switches to control its 16 included commands.

18. Transistor based computer with drum memory. Released by General Percision and Royal McBee in 1960 for $87,500. It resembles the LGP-30, though it is faster, and capable of computing 230,000 operations per minute, and can be connected with up to 60 external devices. The RPC-4000 was built with 500 transistors, 4500 diodes, and a drum memory in size of 8008 words (words = 32 bit).

19. Magnetic-core memory was the predominant form of random-access computer memory for 20 years between about 1955 and 1975. Such memory is often just called core memory, or, informally, core.

20. In computing, a compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.[1][2]:p1

21. Between 1958-1959 The Librazette used the word "marvel" at least three times to describe new technology.

22. Prior to the submission of a piece of software into the machine, it was written by hand.

23. In November 14th-17th 1955 the LGP-30 was presented in the Chicago Automation Show, that was conducted at the Navy Pier in Chicago. The company's representatives in the show were from the company's sales department, along with Stanely Frankel, the computer's architect. (Source: "LGP-30 Wins Wide Acclaim At Chicago Automation Show", Librazette, December 1955, p.6)

24. "Many of the viewers were especially pleased by the appearance of the LGP-30. They commented favorably on the computer's 'new look', referring to the departure from the rack mounting common to most other computers." (Source: "LGP-30 Wins Wide Acclaim At Chicago Automation Show", Librazette, December 1955, p.6)

25. "The Librascope booth in which the  computer  was dis-played  soon  became one  of  the  most popular spots on  the pier for the twelve thousand visitors" (Source: "LGP-30 Wins Wide Acclaim At Chicago Automation Show", Librazette, December 1955, p.6)

26. "A representative of one of the leading Southern California computer manufacturers was head to remark half-humourously, 'Frankly, I'm worried!'" (Source: "LGP-30 Wins Wide Acclaim At Chicago Automation Show", Librazette, December 1955, p.6)

27. Mel's Blackjack Program was used as a demo for marketing purposes to showcase the capabilities of the LGP-30, and as such became the flagship program of the company for this purpose. After porting it to the RPC-4000, Mel added a write-up in which he explained how to operate the program: The interaction between the player ("the machine operator") to the computer was via the Flexorwriter. The output (dealer's prompt questions, card list etc.) was printed out, and the input was typed on the typewriter machine. First, the computer prompted the question "How much do you bet?"; the player typed the amount, and afterwords added an astriek (*) which was used a stop command. "e.g., 150* bets $1.50." (see source in the write up itself). Once the amount is submitted, the Flexowriter will print out "Shuffling" and the computer will siumulate the shuffling of the deck. In order to continue with the game, the shuffling simulation had to be manually stopped (by raising SENSE SWITCH 1). Then, the program printed "Cut" and simulated a cut of the deck. Again, this had to be stopped manually in order to complete the cut (by lowering SENSE SWITCH 1). Then, the program would deal the cards, and the game continued. All questions from the program must be answered on the typewriter keyboard, and must be followed by depressing the stop code (*) key. Permissible affirmative answers are: yes*, ok*, si*, ja*, oui*. Permissible negative    answers are: no*, non*, nein*, nope*, * (only the stop code). Another thing to keep in mind, is that prior to the usage, the player had to setup the machine properly in order to see get a fitting User Interface for the machine's output. As Mel mentions in his write-up:

    "Before playing Blackjack, set 4 typewriter tab stops to provide for 4 columns of printing. The following is the suggested column lengths (left to right) and their content."

      1. 15 spaces. This column will contain alphabetic questions and the player's responses.
      2. 12 spaces. This column will contain the player's cards and their numeric total or an alphabetic comment.
      3. 12 spaces. This column will contain the dealer's (computer's) cards and their numeric total or an alphabetic comment.
      4. 12 spaces. This column will contain the score at the end of each hand.

Secondly, the machine operator had to load the tape to the machine in 10 simple steps:

      1. Place tape in Reader
      2. Select Reader input
      3. Depress ONE OPERATION
      4. Depress EXECUTE LOWER
      5. Depress SET INPUT
      6. Depress START READ on the Reader
      7. Raise EXECUTE LOWER
      8. Depress SET INPUT
      9. Raise ONE OPERATION
      10. Depress START READ on the Reader.

28. In software engineering, porting is the process of adapting software for the purpose of achieving some form of execution in a computing environment that is different from the one that a given program (meant for such execution) was originally designed for (e.g., different CPU, operating system, or third party library). The term is also used when software/hardware is changed to make them usable in different environments. (Wikipedia)

29. The method by which a binary number, or a collection of such numbers, represent a specific location in the computer's memory.

30. This sentence refers to the method that determines the memory address of the next instruction to execute. Normally, digital computers load instructions from consecutive memory locations, unless instructed to jump to a different address. The RPC-4000 had an optional addressing mode in which every instruction included the address of the next instruction to execute.

31. Operation Code - Also abbreviated to "opcode", is the portion of a machine language instruction that specifies the operation to be performed. Beside the opcode itself, most instructions also specify the data they will process, in the form of operands. (Source: Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode)

32. Operand - In mathematics an operand is the object of a mathematical operation, i.e., it is the object or quantity that is operated on. (Source: Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operand)

33. GO TO - is a statement found in many computer programming languages. It performs a one-way transfer of control to another line of code. The jumped-to locations are usually identified using labels, though some languages use line numbers. At the machine code level, a goto is a form of branch or jump statement. Many languages support the goto statement, and many do not. (Source: Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto)

34. Pascal is an imperative and procedural programming language, designed by Niklaus Wirth as a small, efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring. It is named in honour of the French mathematician, philosopher and physicist Blaise Pascal. (Wikipedia)

35. Code that's written in the most efficiant implementation that is possible in within a given machine.

36. See annotation #12 – Assembler.

37. Top-down and bottom-up are both strategies of information processing and knowledge ordering, used in a variety of fields including software, humanistic and scientific theories (see systemics), and management and organization. In practice, they can be seen as a style of thinking, teaching, or leadership.
A top-down approach (also known as stepwise design and stepwise refinement and in some cases used as a synonym of decomposition) is essentially the breaking down of a system to gain insight into its compositional sub-systems in a reverse engineering fashion. In a top-down approach an overview of the system is formulated, specifying, but not detailing, any first-level subsystems. Each subsystem is then refined in yet greater detail, sometimes in many additional subsystem levels, until the entire specification is reduced to base elements. A top-down model is often specified with the assistance of "black boxes", which makes it easier to manipulate. However, black boxes may fail to clarify elementary mechanisms or be detailed enough to realistically validate the model. Top down approach starts with the big picture. It breaks down from there into smaller segments. (Wikipedia)

38. A piece of code or an electronical unit which is meant to delibartely create a delay in the run-time of a program, generally due to an external dependency which adds time to the duration of the task execution.

39. The Friden Flexowriter was a teleprinter, a heavy-duty electric typewriter capable of being driven not only by a human typing, but also automatically by several methods, including direct attachment to a computer and by use of paper tape.
Elements of the design date to the 1920s, and variants of the machine were produced until the early 1970s; the machines found a variety of uses during the evolution of office equipment in the 20th century, including being among the first electric typewriters, computer input and output devices, forerunners of modern word processing, and also having roles in the machine tool and printing industries. (Wikipedia)

40. The Flexowriter's typing speed was 10cps (10 charachters per seconds)

41. Mel implemented a loop by using the _mechanichal_ structure of the machine, rather by implementing it with code. Thus, he designed it by a re-arranging the moving parts of the problem in a new logic, which doesn't necessarily reflect the original design.

42. Positive peak in memory access time.

43. Negative peak in memory access time.

44. Mel's write-up ends with a note: After the program tape has been stored in memory, control is transferred to 00000. Since the Blackjack Program begins at location 000000 it is very easy to transfer to it. (Depress SET INPUT, EXECUTE LOWER, and START.)

45. A loop is a programming technique which allows a sequence of instructions to be performed repeatedly, until some condition prevails (or ceases to hold true). A Common example is searching for and replacing a string in a block of text, until the last occurrence is processed.
A loop is a sequence of statements which is specified once but which may be carried out several times in succession. The code "inside" the loop (the body of the loop, shown below as xxx) is obeyed a specified number of times, or once for each of a collection of items, or until some condition is met, or indefinitely. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow#Loops)

46. The definition of the circuimstances by which a recusrive algorithm should from its recursive operation. Usually, an alogirthm will contain a terminating condition to prevent a case of an Infinite Recursive Loop.

[Alternative:] The terminating condition of a loop is the opposite of the test condition that allows the loop to continue looping. The terminating condition is the condition that stops the looping. (Source: http://teaching.idallen.com/cst8110/97s/LoopTermConditions.html)

47. In computer programming, an infinite loop (or endless loop) is a sequence of instructions that, as written, will continue endlessly, unless an external intervention occurs ("pull the plug"). It may be intentional. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_loop)

48. A register is a memory cell built inside or in close proximity to the CPU. Most of the processor’s operations are performed on data which has been copied into registers.
 
49. This operation increases by one the value stored in the index register. The result is then added to the operand’s address. This mechanism supports the common case where the same instruction(s) should be applied to a series of data. Essentially, the code simply needs to increment the index-register and the repeat.

50. Mel did not use the index-register mechanism. He implemented similar functionality in order to improve his code’s performance. Rather than increment the index-register, Mel change the operand address component of the instruction, wrote the result back to memory and executed it. This process took just enough time for the memory drum to revolve so that the new operand was ready for reading.

51. Bit - The most basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. The name is a contraction of "binary digit". The bit represents a logical state with one of two possible values. These values are most commonly represented as either "1" or "0", but other representations such as true/false, yes/no, +/−, or on/off are commonly used. (Source: Wikiepdia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit)

52. A Bit is considered ON when its value is 1, and OFF when its value is 0.

53. The RPC-4000 allocated 13 bits to the operand address. Thus, the highest addressable location was a number that could fit in 13 bits (neglecting the effect of the index register)..

54. When a number is represented in a certain base, each of its digits may represent, at the most, one less than the value of hte base. For example, the largest digit in decimals is 9  (10 minus 1). In binary numbers, the possible values are 0 and 1. When you try to increase a digit (e.g., in number addition) beyond its limit, the result affects the adjacent higher-order digit. For example, adding 3 to the decimal number 19 yields 22 - the 9 has become 2 and we’ve added 1 to the next digit. When this is done to the leftmost (highest) digit, then we add a digit on the left (e.g. 999 + 1 = 1000). However, a digital computer usually assigns a fixed number of bits to a number, so adding a digit beyond this capacity is not possible. This situation is called “numeric overflow”.

55.  As detailed in footnote 48, the RPC-4000 instructions were composed of 4 parts: The operation code (opcode), the address of the operand (the data which the opcode manipulates or tests), the address of the next instruction and the index bit, which indicates whether or not the number in the index register should be added to the operand address. Nather’s description implies that the bits were laid out as follows (lower to higher): Operand address =>index bit => opcode => next address. Based on this order, increasing the operand address beyond its capacity would affect the index bit and, if the latter is already on, would overflow into the opcode. However, our research shows that that this description doesn’t match the actual layout of the RPC-4000 hardware.

56. Jump Instruction: Forces the processor to execute the next instruction from some address in memory, not necessarily adjacent to the current instruction’s address.. As indicated in footnote 55, Nather’s memory may have failed him on this aspect of the hack. More details can be found in related articles on this site.

57.  The lowest address on the RPC-4000 memory drum is 0.
