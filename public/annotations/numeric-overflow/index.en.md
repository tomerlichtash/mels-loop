When a number is represented in a certain base, each of its digits may represent, at the most, one less than the value of hte base. For example, the largest digit in decimals is 9 (10 minus 1). In binary numbers, the possible values are 0 and 1. When you try to increase a digit (e.g., in number addition) beyond its limit, the result affects the adjacent higher-order digit. For example, adding 3 to the decimal number 19 yields 22 - the 9 has become 2 and we’ve added 1 to the next digit. When this is done to the leftmost (highest) digit, then we add a digit on the left (e.g. 999 + 1 = 1000). However, a digital computer usually assigns a fixed number of bits to a number, so adding a digit beyond this capacity is not possible. This situation is called “numeric overflow”.
