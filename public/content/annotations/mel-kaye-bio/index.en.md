Mel Kaye (Melvin Kornitzky, 1931-2018) was born in Brooklyn to a family of Jewish immigrants and during his childhood moved with his family to Los Angeles. In Summer 1956 Mel joined the commercial department of Librascope, a technology division within General Percision, which held goverment and army contracts. Mel was employed as an Application Engineer in the Commercial Development department in the company's new and fancy Building 3 in Glendale, California, and also acted as a support person to the company's clients to the LGP-30. Within a month from his hiring date, Mel was transferred, along with few other engineers, to Royal-McBee, a business partner of General Percision, that had taken the task of marketing and selling the LGP-30. During his time in Royal-McBee Mel wrote a Blackjack game that ran on the LGP-30, and soon became the flagship demo program for the new machine and was widely used by the company.

When the RPC-4000 was launched Mel had re-wrote (or 'ported') the Blackjack program to be compatible with the RPC-4000, for which he also wrote parts of the Assembly, and as we know from _The Story of Mel_ - also helped Ed Nather with the task of writing a Fortran Compiler to that machine. Due to some differences with the company's managment Mel left Royal-McBee in the early 1960s. Some relics remained of his work, including few hand-written code sheets and a usage guide to the Blackjack program for the RPC-4000.
