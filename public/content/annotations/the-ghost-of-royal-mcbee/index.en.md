In December 1964 Royal-McBee was purchased by Litton, and in 1965 Litton removed the the named McBee. In March 1967 Volkswagen annouced its intention to purchase 55% of Litton's shares through Triumph-Adler, a company owned by Litton, within these shares - the holding of Typewriter Royal. Until 1982 the earnings from sales of Royal and Triumph-Adler piled up to about $600M. In 1983, about a year after this storm of business merges, when Ed Nather publishes _The Story of Mel_, he looks at what used to be Royal-McBee - and sees a ghost. The on-going incarnation of this ghost continued in 1986, when the italian company Olivettei purchased the holdings in Royal. 20 years later, in September 2004, Royal returned to be an American company. Today it's opearing under the name Royal Consumer Information Products Inc. The company manufactures, markets and sells cash registers, paper shredders, electronic logging devices and accessories for photocopiers.
