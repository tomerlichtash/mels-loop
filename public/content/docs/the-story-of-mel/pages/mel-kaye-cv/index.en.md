_Mel Kaye_ (Melvin Kornitzky) was a software engineer, employed at Librascope and at Royal McBee in New York and Los Angeles between the years 1956-1960. Among other programs, he developed a Blackjack game for two first generation digital computers - the LGP-30 and the RPC-4000. The game was highly regarded by fellow engineers and by computer science students. Mel also conceived the ingenious hack described in The Story of Mel, by Ed Nather, published on the internet in 1983. This story won Mel world fame in the hacking community and is regarded as a seminal epic in hacking folklore.

Mel was born on January 14th 1931 in Brooklyn, NY, as Melvin Kornitzky, son of Esther and Herman Kaye. During his early childhood, the family relocated to the west coast and later settled down in Lemon Grove, Los Angeles.

After passing away in 2018, Mel was buried in the Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks-Griffin Memorial Park, Los Angeles.

## The University Years

Around 1948, Mel entered his undergraduate studies in UCLA, still under the name Melvin Kornitzky. This name was used in the 1951 university yearbook, but the 1952 issue already called him Melvin Kaye. We do not know what faculties he attended and whether or not he majored in any discipline.

During his studies, Mel was a member of the Jewish fraterity Tau Delta Phi, which ended its activity in the ‘70s.

After finishing his studies in 1952, with the Stevenson/Eisenhower presidential race …, Mel and his father Heman Kaye registered in the Los Angeles voters book.

## Programming in the Early Years of the Computer Era

In the summer of 1956, Mel Joined the commercial department of Librascope, a technology unit in the General Precision company. The latter had won some government contracts to build military devices. The company’s main products were military technologies for aerial and naval warfare. In the mid 50’s, General Precision started developing a first generation digital computer branded LGP-30 and incorporated a dedicated development unit into its Royal McBee subsidiary. Royal McBee was tasked with marketing and selling the computer.

Mel worked as an applications engineer in the commercial development group, housed in the modern and luxurious building #3 at the company campus in Glendale, California. Among other duties, he helped with teaching customers how to program the LGP-30. About a month after he was recruited to the job, Mel and many of his colleagues were transferred to Royal McBee, where he wrote the Blacjack program which became the company’s poster software.
When Royal McBee was ready to launch its new computer, the RPC-4000, was nearing its launch, Mel rewrote the game for this platform. In addition, he wrote parts of the machine’s assembler and helped Ed Nather write the machine’s Fortran compiler. In the early 60’s, following some misalignments between his opinions and those of management, Mel left Royal McBee. The only relics from his work there are The Story of Mel, a few photocopies of handwritten computer code and the preface that he wrote to the rewritten Blackjack program.

</figure>

It seems that Mels recruitment to Librascope was hastened, possibly due to increased needs from the company’s customers. In July of 1965, the company’s internal magazine (Librazette) ran a story about the company’s instruction and support program for LGP-30 users.. Mel, 25 years old at the time, was mentioned among the engineers who led the program. Only a month later did the Librazette publish a greeting to new hires, among which Mel was listed as a member of the Engineering and Commerce department.

Mel’s work in Librascope and Royal McBee was diverse and apparently lasted around 4 years, until 1960. In July 1961, the Librazette greeted the veteran employees - those who had completed five years or more in the company, nicknamed Libravetes. Mels name was absent from the list.

## Code Remnants

A few handwritten code fragments, probably in his own handwriting, survived from Mel’s work in Librascope. Below are some code sheets from Bill Breiner’s archive, along with a preface that Mel had written for the Blackjack game.

## Origins: Coast to Coast Migration

Little is known about Mel’s parents. Most of the relevant details in various databases pertain to the family of Mel’s father - Kornitzka.

Mel’s father, Herman Kaye, was born on May 2nd, 1905 in Warsaw, Poland as Nehemia Kornitzka. At the tender age of two, he immigrated to the United states with his mother, Hela Kornitzka (Mel’s grandmother). They boarded the cargo ship Estonia, operated by the East Asiatic company and sailed from Russia to the US.Upon their arrival, the changed their family name to Kornitzky and settled in Brooklyn, New York. later on, they changed the name again, this time to the more American Kaye.

Mel’s mother, Esther Fietelewitch, was born in 1907 to a Russian-Jewish family. Her father, Abraham, worked in construction, while her mother was a homemaker. The household language was Yiddish. The Fietelewitches immigrated to the United States in the 1920’s and settled down in Watkins st., Brooklyn, NYC. Esther grew up there, along with her brothers and sister: Benny, Sam and Celia.

Herman Kaye and Esther Fietelewitch were married on June 27 1925. Herman was in the TV manufacturing business and later started a successful mobile home company. Esther was a homemaker.

Herman Kaye passed away on December 16th 1979 in Anaheim, Los Angeles.
Esther Kaye passed away on January 15th 1994, in Orange County, Los Angeles. The two are buried side by side in the Beth Olam cemetery, Los Angeles.

## An American Family

On May 24th 1953, Mel married Rita Bernstein, born in England on May 27th 1933. Only two years before their marriage, On January 30th 1951, she boarded the SS Britannic which sailed from Liverpool to New York, on her way to start a new life in the US. Shortly after their marriage, the couple applied for American citizenship for Rita. She passed away on July 30th 2011 and was burried in the Valley Oaks Memorial park. 7 years later, Mel would find his final resting next to her.

## Final words

Mel never sought (or even acknowledged) his glory in the hacking culture. In fact, only one person managed to track him down and extract a few words out of him. Anthony Cuozzo, a computer programmer and hacking folklore buf who grew to admire the character portrayed in The Story of Mel. Following a clue he uncovered during his search for Mel, he wrote an email to rimel3@roadrunner.com (possibly an acronym for Rita and Mel), hoping it would reach the legendary engineer. Our research in the Mel’s Loop project supports Cuozzo’s hunch.

Thus wrote Anthony Cuozzo on April 2012:

<figure dir="ltr">
    Anthony Cuozzo <acuozzo@***.********.***>
    Tue, Apr 17, 2012 at 10:59 AM
    To: rimel3@roadrunner.com

    Hello Mel,
    Did you once work for Librascope Inc. or Royal McBee?
    Thanks,
    Anthony

<figcaption>Anthony Cuozoo's email to Mel Kaye, 2012.</figcaption>

Within an hour, Mel replied:

<figure dir="ltr">

    To: acuozzo@***.********.***

    Yes, I did, many, many years ago I worked for both of them.
    I believe I worked for Royal McBee first.
    Mel Kaye

<figcaption>Mel's final email</figcaption>
</figure>

Upon receiving the reply, Cuozzo tried to continue the correspondence, but Mel fell silent. When we reached out to his family, they were ostensibly unwilling to discuss either the myth or the man behind it. There are probably more chapters in this story. The research continues.
