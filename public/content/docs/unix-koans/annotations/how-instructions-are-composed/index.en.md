The RPC-4000 instructions were composed of 4 parts: The operation code (opcode), the address of the operand (the data which the opcode manipulates or tests), the address of the next instruction and the index bit, which indicates whether or not the number in the index register should be added to the operand address. Nather’s description implies that the bits were laid out as follows (lower to higher): Operand address =>index bit => opcode => next address. Based on this order, increasing the operand address beyond its capacity would affect the index bit and, if the latter is already on, would overflow into the opcode. However, our research shows that that this description doesn’t match the actual layout of the RPC-4000 hardware.
