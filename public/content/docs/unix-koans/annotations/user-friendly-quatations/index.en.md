The term 'user-friendly' is used in quotations here in, I believe, a couple of different meanings. One is that software that is called 'user-friendly' very often isn't. Oftentimes the extra window dressing put onto a piece of software to make it user-friendly serves mostly to make it harder to use. The other meaning is a reference to the 'real programmer' ethic. One on-line collection of real-programmer-isms says something to the effect of `Software is hard to write, it should be hard to use.'' To programmers of this ethic, adding extra code simply to make the program easier to use is wasted effort. People who value the contribution of the code should have to spend the effort to learn how to use it.
