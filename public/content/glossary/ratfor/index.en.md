A dialect of FORTRAN that provides a richer set of control-flow possibilities. RATFOR is not a new language, rather it is a translator that translates Rational FORTRAN into FORTRAN. It allows the programmer to use features not found in the normal FORTAN language, and then translates those features into standard FORTAN automatically.
