Vacuum tubes are electronic devices used to amplify electronic signals and to act as electronically controlled switches. Digital computers are constructed at their most basic fundamental building blocks as electronically controlled switches. The very first electronic computers used relays for these switches (in the 1940's). Vacuum tubes were used for the switches from the late 40's to the late 50's. The first commercial computer to use transistors for the switching elements was the IBM 1401 in 1959 starting the end of the tube era. Individual transistors gave way to integrated circuits in which hundreds, and eventually millions, of transistors were fabricated on a single silicon substrate, or chip. Integrated circuits have been used from the mid-60's to the present.
