Transistor based computer with drum memory. Released by General Percision and Royal McBee in 1960 for $87,500. It resembles the LGP-30, though it is faster, and capable of computing 230,000 operations per minute, and can be connected with up to 60 external devices. The RPC-4000 was built with 500 transistors, 4500 diodes, and a drum memory in size of 8008 words (words = 32 bit).
