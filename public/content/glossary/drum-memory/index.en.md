Refers to drum memories which are magnetic data storage devices much like the familiar hard disks of today but shaped like cylinders instead of platters. In the 50's and 60's the state of the art in magnetic encoding of data didn't allow for very dense storage on the magnetic surface of the medium. So, in order to increase the surface area of the storage medium, to increase the speed at which the magnetic material passed by the read head of the device, and to keep the speed at which the heads encountered the magnetic medium constant, these devices were shaped like cylinders with the magnetic coating on the outside surface of the cylinder and the cylinder rotating along its long axis at very high speeds. Consider the early phonographs which were wax cylinders versus the now-becoming-obsolete vinyl record. The considerations are analogous to the drum versus disk question.
