In computer programming, machine code, consisting of machine language instructions, is a low-level programming language used to directly control a computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU). Each instruction causes the CPU to perform a very specific task, such as load, store, jump, or an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) operation on one or more units of data in the CPU's registers or memory.

For instance, an instruction that is used to perform addition to the content in Register A, with the content in Register B, and save the result to Register C, would look like this: 1010 0011 0100 0001.
