We're happy to announce the first publication of The Story of Mel in Hebrew. The publication sees first light within the 13th volume of the literary periodical [Dehak](https://mitzlolpoetry.wixsite.com/dehak/13). This is the first time the story sees light within an actual literary platform, as a piece of actual folklore.

Along with the translation we've added an introductory preface, and 50-some sidenotes, to ease the read for the non-tech reader. Full text, with preface and comments will soon be published on Mel's Loop website.
