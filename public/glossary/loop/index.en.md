A loop is a programming technique which allows a sequence of instructions to be performed repeatedly, until some condition prevails (or ceases to hold true). A Common example is searching for and replacing a string in a block of text, until the last occurrence is processed.

A loop is a sequence of statements which is specified once but which may be carried out several times in succession. The code "inside" the loop (the body of the loop, shown below as xxx) is obeyed a specified number of times, or once for each of a collection of items, or until some condition is met, or indefinitely.
